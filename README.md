# Vue.js To-Do List Application

## Overview

This application is a to-do list management system built with Vue.js. It allows users to add, manage, and organize tasks into different categories such as "To Do," "On Progress," and "Done." It includes features for adding new tasks with detailed attributes, sorting tasks, and ensuring data persistence across sessions.

## Key Features

Task Management : Users can add new tasks, set their priority, and define deadlines.

- Task Organization : Tasks are categorized into different sections like "To Do," "On Progress," and "Done," and can be moved between these categories based on their completion status.
- Data Persistence : The application uses localStorage to save the state of the to-do list. This ensures that user data persists across sessions, so tasks and categories remain consistent even after the browser is closed or refreshed.
- Date Formatting : Dates are formatted according to the Indonesian locale for user convenience.

## How It Works

- Adding Tasks : Users can open a modal to input new tasks, including title, priority, and deadline. Tasks are then added to the appropriate category.
- Managing Tasks : Tasks can be marked as completed, which automatically moves them to the "Done" category, or they can be deleted if no longer needed.
- Persistence with LocalStorage : Upon initialization, the application loads the to-do list from localStorage. Any changes made to the tasks or categories are saved back to localStorage, ensuring data is retained across sessions.

## Main Data Structure

The main data used in the application consists of categories and tasks. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the data structure :

```js
;[
	{
		id: 0,
		name: "To Do",
		todoTasks: [],
	},
	{
		id: 1,
		name: "On Progress",
		todoTasks: [],
	},
	{
		id: 2,
		name: "Done",
		todoTasks: [],
	},
]
```

- id : A unique identifier for the category.
- name : The name of the category (e.g., "To Do," "On Progress," "Done").
- todoTasks : An array containing tasks assigned to this category.
  **Task**

```js
{
    "id" : generateRandomId(),
    "name" : newInput.value.title,
    "priority" : newInput.value.priority,
    "created" : new Date(),
    "deadline" : newInput.value.deadline,
    "tasks" : [...newInput.value.tasks]
}
```

- id : A unique identifier for the task, generated using generateRandomId().
- name : The title of the task, provided by the user.
- priority : The priority level of the task (e.g., Low, Medium, High), set by the user.
- created : The date and time when the task was created.
- deadline : The deadline for the task, as set by the user.
- tasks : An array of subtasks associated with the main task.
